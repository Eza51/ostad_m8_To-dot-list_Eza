# ✅ Basic Todo List with Status Filter

A simple Todo List built using **pure JavaScript only** — no HTML or UI involved.  
Each task has a `title` and a `done` status (true/false), and the program organizes tasks into two categories:

- ✅ Completed Tasks  
- ⏳ Ongoing Tasks

---

## 🎯 Features

- Array of task objects: each with `title` and `done`
- `filter()` used to separate completed and ongoing tasks
- Output printed using `console.log()` in two clear sections
